## Next Word Predictor

This project is a Smart Next Word Recommender built with TensorFlow and Streamlit. It predicts and suggests the most likely next words given an input sentence, helping users with word completion and text prediction.

## Features

- Uses a trained TensorFlow model for predicting the next word.
- Utilizes a tokenizer to convert words to sequences and vice versa.
- Streamlit-based user interface for interactive word prediction.
- Suggestions are displayed as clickable buttons to add predicted words easily.

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - The main Streamlit app for user interaction and prediction.
- `next_word_predictor.py` - Model training and tokenizer preparation script.
- `requirements.txt` - Required Python packages.
